            header: 'What is a unique/non-unique purchase?'
          })
            p Non-exclusive purchase means that other people can buy the template you have chosen some time later. Exclusive or unique purchase guarantees that you are the last person to buy this template. After an exclusive purchase occurs the template is being permanently removed from the sales directory and will never be available to other customers again. Only you and people who bought the template before you will own it.
