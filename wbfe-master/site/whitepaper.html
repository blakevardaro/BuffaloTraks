                                 PAY>TRAK$ is a legal, organizational, and technological system to provide for payment
                                 and tracking and to enforce federal, tribal and state cannabis and currency laws.
                                 PAY>TRAK$ can increase state tax revenues, reduce federal, state, tribal and business
                                 regulatory costs and prevent financial crimes; and, it can be used in almost any
                                 industry or government application involving payments and tracking.

                              <p>
                                 Many states approved marijuana for medical or recreational use, but marijuana remains a
                                 Schedule I illegal drug at the federal level. Thus, the cannabis industry cannot use
                                 banks to conduct business: they must use cash, which enables a myriad of crimes. Even
                                 if marijuana is decriminalized nationally, this newly emerging industry still needs
                                 rigorous payment and product controls, which the PAY>TRAK$ system provides. The United
                                 States Hemp Farming Act of 2018 requires that product tracking be regulated and
                                 recorded. PAY>TRAK$ can meet all these needs.

                                 We designed TRAK$>CREDITS as a programmable distributed ledger technology asset. They
                                 will be exclusively offered to Co-op Patrons in our uniquely created system, for which
                                 we are obtaining authorizations through state securities departments and the S.E.C.
                                 TRAK$ are not designed as securities, tokens, cryptocurrencies, or coins. Instead,
                                 TRAK$ are programmable co-op digital assets or distributed ledger technology assets.
                                 The initial use case is to provide convenient payments, tax remittances, and integrated
                                 logistical tracking of cannabis production, transportation, and sales in Oklahoma on
                                 behalf of the Oklahoma Tax Commission, tribes and the Patrons of the White Buffalo
                                 Co-op. The Co-op patronage design is a special ingredient in dealing with the
                                 securities problems faced by other digital assets. Active participants and Patrons will
                                 include industry representatives, industrial hemp farmers and individual medical
                                 marijuana licensees. The Co-op is open to any person or entity who verifies their
                                 identity (unless, of course, they are a terrorist or a money launderer) and who agree
                                 not to use TRAK$>Credits for speculative purposes. The Co-op is working closely with
                                 the S.E.C. and the state securities regulators to create a non-security store of value
                                 and a limited cooperative association, which everyone owns as patrons and which
                                 includes a Digital Village that uses the TRAK$ series of digital assets.

                                 that our Co-op digital assets, HODL>TRAK$, are either exempt under federal law or are
                                 not within Oklahoma Securities Department jurisdiction. We continue with that process
                                 and have engaged with the United States Securities Exchange Commission. We also have
                                 made disclosures in meetings with the Oklahoma Attorney General’s office and the
                                 Oklahoma Banking Department.
                                 Blockstack, a start-up crypto company, recently spent $2 million to get a Securities
                                 Exchange Commission Reg A+ offering approved. Only two tokens out of hundreds have
                                 received no action letters from the S.E.C.

                                 <strong>LAW BEFORE TECH.</strong> The TRAK$ design process has been to build use case,
                                 organization, and legal compliance first, then build the technical solution. The Tribal
                                 Reserve System is two decades in the making, and its existing infrastructure should
                                 allow both TRAK$>Credits and HODL>TRAK$ to be treated as non-securities. All HODL>TRAK$
                                 owners are afforded voting rights to influence policy concerning TRAK$ and the
                                 governance of the democratized Co-op. HODL>TRAK$ are not tradeable and are membership
                                 certificates in accordance with the bylaws and represent contractual agreements between
                                 the Patron and the Co-op.

                                 <strong> STABLE DIGITAL ASSET:</strong> Create and launch an exempt, non-security
                                 distributed ledger technology asset that can be legally used by the patrons of the
                                 White Buffalo Co-op for payment and tracking. TRAK$>Credits, USD Tribal Reserve
                                 (USDTR), and the White Buffalo Co-op are legally structured to operate under multiple
                                 securities exemptions and to be non-securities. The Securities and Exchange
                                 Commission’s April 2019 “Turn-Key Jet” memorandum, the Howey investment contract test,
                                 and the risk capital securities test have guided us in designing TRAK$>Credits and
                                 HODL>TRAK$. The Oklahoma Uniform Limited Cooperative Association Act and federal case
                                 law specify securities exemptions for Co-ops, thereby allowing the Tribal Reserve and
                                 our Limited Cooperative Association self-governance an exempt series of digital assets.

                                 industrial hemp farming, states have legalized cannabis, but they lack payment and
                                 product tracking capabilities. PAY>TRAK$ can greatly increase state tax revenues and

                                 using cash. The L.L.C. will be a regulated, electronic fund transfer and tracking
                                 network platform that ensures fast, secure transactions using TRAK$>CREDITS. The Tribal
                                 Reserve’s Oklahoma PAY>TRAK$ L.L.C. (a UTAH PAY>TRAK$ L.L.C. affiliate), received an
                                 authorization to collect taxes in Oklahoma using our proprietary digital asset,
                                 TRAK$>Credits. (See Exhibit A.) Our legal strategy calls for getting a similar
                                 authorization to collect cannabis payments and taxes in Utah.
                              </p>
                              <p>UTAH PAY>TRAK$ L.L.C. can optimally gross 9% of $500 million, $45 million per year from
                                 merchant services within the Utah cannabis industry by 2024. Oklahoma, with a similar
                                 population size as Utah, is where the Tribal Reserve has its headquarters. Oklahoma has
                                 already wildly exceeded expectations and is on course to exceed $200 million in the
                                 first year of legalized cannabis (2019).

                                 <strong>FINANCIAL CRIME PREVENTION:</strong> By using our prepaid digital assets
                                 (TRAK$>Credits) and advanced technologies, UTAH PAY>TRAK$ L.L.C. can help the Utah
                                 authorities and industry follow the money in near real-time, using an easily available
                                 dashboard. The Company can help eliminate money laundering, tax evasion, identity
                                 theft, robbery, embezzlement, and the black market, and can obviate the need for using
                                 cash, checks, or banks. UTAH PAY>TRAK$ can do this and at the same time protect the
                                 privacy and identities of all Utah citizens.

                              <h4>Security Considerations</h4>
                              <p>
                                 Since the advent of distributed ledger technology there have been a number of highly
                                 publicized hacks and attacks related to blockchain assets. Although it is absolutely
                                 imperative to continuously improve upon security practices, it is equally prudent to
                                 understand the design flaws in the ecosystem. The majority of successful attacks have
                                 been based around exchanges, not on the blockchains themselves. Specifically, this is
                                 caused by the divergence between the core concepts of distributed ledgers and the
                                 nature of exchanges. Blockchains are meant to be decentralized to increase the number
                                 of verified sources of truth, whereas exchanges are meant to be high-speed, dynamic
                                 platforms where transactions are computed as quickly and often as users require. This
                                 leads to platforms designed in traditional, centralized architectures and security
                                 protocols. In turn, it opens the platform up to the entirety of current hacking
                                 strategies used on modern platforms. These are in large part derived from social
                                 engineering, i.e., rainbow charts, phishing, pretexting, and combinatorial attacks.
                                 Keeping all of this in mind, all transactions will be executed within the TRAK$
                                 platform with all critical data written to the blockchain. Increases in speed for user
                                 interaction will be achieved by providing non-critical meta-data in databases as well
                                 as maintaining a high level of throughput via deployed infrastructure.

                                 The current design is focused on being as fast as
                                 possible while also future-proofing blockchain related
                                 implementations.

                                 As web-assembly continues to gain momentum and adoption
                                 in web development the TRAK$ Progressive Web Application
                                 will be refactored using the Rust programming language.
                                 This will also allow for better user experience as Wi-Fi
                                 and internet infrastructure continues to be upgraded

                                 <p>
                                    TRAK$ will be a distributed ledger based ecosystem that
                                    will allow for interoperability between the TRAK$ suite
                                    of applications. The blockchain portion of the platform
                                    (right side of diagram) will consist of smart contracts
                                    (see below), integration with Ripple for payments at
                                    speed, and a REST API to tie together the two blockchain
                                    systems with front-end interactions. Another inherent
                                    portion of the implementation will be MetaMask, an open
                                    free browser extension that allows for direct
                                    interaction to Ethereum Mainnet. Having this extension
                                    will be a prerequisite for executing transactions on the
                                    TRAK$ Progressive Web Platform.

                                    <p>
                                       Smart Contracts will be the means by which the TRAK$ platform will make
                                       decisions. As a publicly hosted blockchain dApp, our governance model will exist
                                       in the technology and database structure, allowing all members of the Co-op to
                                       interact as needed. In that way, all business logic will be hosted on the public
                                       Ethereum Mainnet blockchain. Each smart contract will be permission to only
                                       interact with authenticated Co-op Patrons for transactions and can only be
                                       modified by a whitelisted administrator of the Co-op. This is an important
                                       feature because as the Co-op and its By-laws and requirements change, TRAK$ will
                                       need to periodically change the business logic that governs the TRAK$ dApp.

                                             is a scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and
                                             is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third
                                             party. The test of whether there is an "investment contract" under the
                                             Securities Act is whether the scheme involves an investment of money in a
                                             common enterprise with profits to come solely from the efforts of others.
                                             The policy of the Securities Act of affording broad protection to investors
                                             is not to be thwarted by unrealistic and irrelevant formulae.

                                             <strong>Uniform Limited Cooperative Association Act (LCA): </strong> This
                                             act combines an unincorporated and flexible organizational structure with
                                             cooperative principles and values in order to obtain increased equity
                                             investment opportunity for capital intensive and start-up cooperative
                                             enterprises. It encourages equity investment by allowing, but not
                                             requiring, a limited cooperative association to have voting investor
                                             members in addition to patron members. Giving equity investors even limited
                                             voice in operations on an ongoing basis is the biggest defining feature
                                             distinguishing this act from other cooperative acts. Nonetheless, it is
                                             possible to view the distinction between debt and equity as one of degree
                                             rather than of kind. In effect this act allows a limited cooperative
                                             association to substitute equity capital with limited, but real, governance
                                             rights for debt capital and lenders, through loan covenants, can control
                                             some activities of any kind of entity.

                                             <strong>Uniform Limited Cooperative Association Act (LCA):</strong> This
                                             act combines an unincorporated and flexible organizational structure with
                                             cooperative principles and values in order to obtain increased equity
                                             investment opportunity for capital intensive and start-up cooperative
                                             enterprises. It encourages equity investment by allowing, but not
                                             requiring, a limited cooperative association to have voting investor
                                             members in addition to patron members. Giving equity investors even limited
                                             voice in operations on an ongoing basis is the biggest defining feature
                                             distinguishing this act from other cooperative acts. Nonetheless, it is
                                             possible to view the distinction between debt and equity as one of degree
                                             rather than of kind. In effect this act allows a limited cooperative
                                             association to substitute equity capital with limited, but real, governance
                                             rights for debt capital and lenders, through loan covenants, can control
                                             some activities of any kind of entity.
